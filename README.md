# check-prime-number-js
20 days of JavaScript coding streak - day 4

In the above program, the user is prompted to enter a number. The number entered by the user is checked if it is greater than 1 using if...else if... else statement.

1 is considered neither prime nor composite.
All negative numbers are excluded because prime numbers are positive.
Numbers greater than 1 are tested using a for loop.
The for loop is used to iterate through the positive numbers to check if the number entered by the user is divisible by positive numbers (2 to user-entered number minus 1).

The condition number % i == 0 checks if the number is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.

If the remainder value is evaluated to 0, that number is not a prime number.
The isPrime variable is used to store a boolean value: either true or false.
The isPrime variable is set to false if the number is not a prime number.
The isPrime variable remains true if the number is a prime number.
